# RL^2
#### Reinforcement Learning *Learning*



This repository serve as a resource for those (including myself) who are learning Reinforcement Learning.
It is mainly intended (but not limited) to allocate examples of code in different RL libraries (at the moment only in OpenAI gym); pointer to good resources to learn Reinforcement Learning and also point to cool projects/start-ups built upon this exciting technology.


### Update 29.12

Started adding a mini RL library. It is called [RL4Control](https://github.com/rafardenas/RL2/tree/master/RL4Control), and the idea is to implement several "classic" RL algorithms (e.g. Monte Carlo, Q-learning, SARSA) and Deep RL to control chemical processes.
I have not seen a lot resources on the topic (maybe because it is kind of niche), and I hope that people can find these (beginner) implementations useful.
