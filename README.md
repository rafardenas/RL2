#### Reinforcement Learning *Learning*

This repository serve as a resource for those (including myself) that are learning Reinforcement Learning.
It is mainly intended (but not limited) to allocate examples of code in different RL libraries (at the moment only in OpenAI gym); pointer to good resources to learn Reinforcement Learning and also point to cool projects/start-ups built upon this exciting technology.
