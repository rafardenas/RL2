#### Control of Chemical Processes with RL

Reinforcement Learning has sparked the interest of awesome minds around the world and in the last decade huge advacements have been made. There are still awesome oportunities in fields that have not been as heavily addressed as, for example, robotics or videogames, namely, the "classical" industries: Chemical, manufacturing, etc.

This repository is one small effort towards spreading RL in these disciplines, here, I have layed the foundations of a library to help start quickly and easy experimenting with Reinforcement Learning from the Chemical Engineering perspective.

To knowledge, what is unique about this proposal is the availability of *Chemical Environments* which are essentially kinetic models with predefined control actions and reward functions, think on OpenAI Gym, but for Chemical Engineering ;).
Also, commonly used algorithms and techniques are available, (Deep Q Network, experience replay, tabular methods), with time, more environments and algorithms will be added.

The long term vision of this library is to serve as a reference of RL in chemical engineering and a vehicle to distribute the breakthroughs of RL in Chemical Engineering among the ML community.
